As the data science job market burgeons, potential employees often grapple with gauging whether the salary offered aligns with market standards, due to the absence of a reference framework. Addressing this gap, This project delves into the analysis of data science-related job salaries, leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset encompasses a range of attributes such as work year, experience level, employment type, job title, salary in USD, employee residence, remote ratio, and more. However, the focal point of the analysis rests on key predictors like experience level, job title, employee residence, and remote ratio to unveil their influence on salaries, measured in USD and adjusted for inflation based on the offer year.  The project employs linear regression and tree-based random forest models with different hyperparameters in its initial phase. Each model incorporates predictors such as job title, country of employee residence, work mode (remote, hybrid, on-site), and experience level (from entry to senior levels), with the inflation-adjusted salary in USD serving as the outcome variable. The findings from these models underscore a significant correlation between the stated predictors and data science job salaries, highlighting notable variations across different countries and experience levels. 

xSubsequently, a comparative error analysis of various models led to the selection of the linear regression model for salary prediction. This choice was informed by comparing the mean squared error of the models, where linear regression model demonstrated a smallest squared error. The final model can predict the estimated salary based on the employee's residence, job title, employee residence, and remote ratio etc. The culmination of this analysis not only provides valuable insights into the salary dynamics within the data science domain but also underpins a web application designed to offer employees a benchmark for evaluating job offers in this field. This application, fueled by the linear regression model's predictions, stands as a testament to the practical applicability of the project's findings, empowering data science professionals with a robust tool for informed salary negotiations.
